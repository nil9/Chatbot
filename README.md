# Chatbot

History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: Eliza.

On similar lines let's create a very basic chatbot utlising the Python's NLTK library.It's a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills,but still a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots.
